# Intel-Image-Classification

This project is an Intel Scene Classification Challenge on Kaggle. In this challenge we have to classify six different categories (buildings, mountain, sea, street, forest, glacier). We read the data and perform pre-processing steps like Removing Noise, Data Augmentation. We then train a deep learning model for Image Classification using Convolutional Neural networks and will experiment with different CNN architectures, tuning parameters, data augmentation.
